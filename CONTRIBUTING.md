## Contributing to the Tipline 🌱 🌱
Hello! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Deepfakes Analysis Unit (DAU) run by the Misinformation Combat Alliance. 😊

The MCA Deepfakes Analysis is intended as a collaborative effort between journalists, technologists, academics and social scientists committed to responding to misinformation, and in particular synthetic media. The DAU involves many different people, across different organizations.

## Scope ⭕

Tattle's work on this project is specific to developing the dashboard used by the fact checkers and verification experts to monitor, triage and respond to messages coming on the WhatsApp tipline. This repository is the right place to begin if you want to support in building the dashboard to increase efficiency of the verification workflows. This could involve building open source forensics tools relevant to synthetic media, or media operators for similarity matching and clustering in Indian language across videos and audio, or spam filtering. Head to the next section to learn how to contribute. 

If you are a media organization, OSINT researcher, academic organization that wants to support in day-to-day verification work; or want access to data for research, please reach out to the DAU nodal team at the Misinformation Combat Alliance. They can be contacted at.
