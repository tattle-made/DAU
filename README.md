# DAU_tipline

## Motivation
As videos closely mimic reality, it is important to provide a speedy response on ( a) whether a video is manipulated, (b) correct context and content on the video. It is also important to educate the public on the possibilities and limits of the technology in manipulating videos, and ways in which they can protect themselves. Finally, since the capabilities of AI in manipulating and generating videos is rapidly evolving, there is a need for data that enables research on this.


## Background
Rapid advances in generative AI has led to the emergence of AI generated content that is blurring the lines between fiction and reality. Fact checkers now don’t just have to point out what is false but also inform people what is indeed true. Over the past few months, a series of audio clips and videos that were altered (and in some cases, also real) has gotten the moniker “deepfakes”. To tackle the problem effectively there is a need for research on the types and challenges of deepfakes, as well as timely response. The [Misinformation Combat Alliance](https://mcaindia.in/), is setting up a Deepfake Analysis Unit (DAU) that will respond to and research content that comes on a WhatsApp tipline.  

## Scope of this repository
This repository contains code pertaining to the WhatsApp Tipline for the Deepfake Analysis Unit. 

## Timeline and Deliverables (Link to GitHub Project when it is ready)
Feb 29 2023: 
  * A tipline on which people can send media content and that gives basic response (acknowledgement of media receipt with a time duration for response).
  * Basic spam filtering
March 31 2023: 
  * Automated response with verification status for videos that have been verified.
  * Improvements to spam detection.
  * Implement workflows for approximate search

## TBD:
* What happens when a new media item comes to the tipline?
  * It remains on the dashboard to which all members of DAU have access
  * It is redirected to individual fact checker tiplines with metadata to signify this came from DAU.
 
* What is appropriate reponse for approximate match?
